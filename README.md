## General info
This is a repository of ML approaches spanning from regression over clustering to recommender systems. So far, the code is mainly from the coursera course "Machine Learning" from Stanford Online. I plan to refactor most of the classes for my personal use due to the fact, that those implementations are very fast, bug-free and can be used from the command line. <br>
Please note, that I personally have altered most of the important machine learning algorithms listed here.
